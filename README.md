# Instagram Shadowbans: Testing for Algorithmic Changes in Treatment of 'Political' Content

This repository contains analysis code for my master's thesis, submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Master of Arts in Computational Social Science at University of Chicago.

## Python files
**variables**: contains constants imported across notebooks
## Notebooks
**eda**: Exploratory data analysis of preliminary and final dataset <br>
**model_comparison**: Comparison of model architectures <br>
**get_residuals** and **residual_analysis**: Data drift and model drift tests and results <br>
- This notebook includes supplemental analysis of the second policy change, which was not included in the paper due to less data in the `after' set and closer time to data collection (so likes may not be stable).
